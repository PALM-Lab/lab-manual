# Lab culture {#lab-culture}

This chapter describes the structure and culture within the PALM Lab. The goal is to be clear about expectations for the members of the lab (ones that William has, as well as for each other) and importantly for William himself.

> _This section aims to provide a picture of what mentoring and working with me will be like in the PALM Lab. It will continually be in-progress, shaped by (and including) feedback from lab members and others alike. -- William_

## Our lab environment {#lab-environment}

The lab should be a welcoming space for all members to work and conduct research. Everyone should be respectful and kind to each other, providing support and encouragement at all times. We are a team that shares in our successes, rather than competes with each other to get ahead (*and resists current incentive structures in science*). In fact, lab members are encouraged to take an interest in each others' work, learning from each other and collaborate on research.

Getting to know each other beyond being colleagues at work provides a strong basis for developing community within the lab. William encourages (and will help fund and/or organize) social events for the lab, but note that participation will always be optional. The goal is to have every member feel like they belong in the lab. (Note that William welcomes any opportunity to take a quick break from work to grab a coffee and chat.)

> _I am mindful that conflicts may arise between lab members or with others externally. I will do my best to [mediate any issues](#conflicts) to the best resolution for all parties. To this end, I value clear communication - I will try my best to ensure the lab space is safe to bring up any disagreements or problems, especially so if they involve me. I hope that in a world that seems to be increasingly divided, we can nurture an environment that can resolve conflicts by listening to each other and having mutual resepct. -- William_

It is the responsibility of all lab members to keep the lab space organized and tidy, and to maintain a good working environment for all. This includes:

* Cleaning any rubbish or waste found in common spaces
* Putting lab equipment back in place after use
* Being considerate with shared spaces or resources (including dividing shared spaces or resources equitably, and communicating if something occurs that may impact others)
* Being mindful about taking up one's time or interrupting others' work in the lab (including the volume of nearby conversations)
* Taking an interest in other lab members' research projects (such as paying attention during talks or lab meetings)
* Offering to pilot each other's experiments or assist with data collection (such as gelling in EEG)

## Expectations about work {#lab-work}

It is important to maintain work-life balance (*in the face of capitalistic academic structures*) to ensure one's health, enjoyment in doing science, and to prevent burnout. Do prioritize taking breaks during the day, managing life's responsibilities and keeping one's commitment to others.

Work hours are mostly flexible - the PALM Lab adopts a 'hybrid model' where lab members are expected to spend at least a few days of the week working on campus/in lab. Ultimately, all lab members are responsible for managing and organizing their time to ensure research goals are met. You are not expected to work during evenings, weekends or public holidays. (*The one possible exception may be during critical deadlines, such as for conferences or grants. William will be as mindful as he can be of this, and if he does ask for something, you can be upfront and say it is not possible.*)

You are expected to stay home when you are sick, so that others (lab members, colleagues, participants) do not catch any illnesses. If this happens, please reschedule any meetings as soon as you can.

> _As your mentor, I will set regular (~weekly) check-in meetings with you to align expectations on what work needs to be achieved and if they are being met. These meetings will be an opportunity to communicate to me about any concerns or struggles, so that I am aware and can help support you or make plans to continue to make progress. -- William_

### Expectations around communication

Communication should always be with kindness and respectful of each other's time. General guidelines for various forms of communication are as follows:

* For most communication about lab-related matters, the PALM Lab uses **Slack**.
  * Slack can cause a lot of interruption to workflows. For this reason, it is not expected for Slack to be open at all times; it is recommended curating (or turning off) notifications to help maintain their focus on work. However, Slack should be checked periodically (~twice a day) to ensure no messages are missed.
  * The PALM Lab is on the free plan of Slack, which means **message history is restricted to 90 days**. As a result, communication in Slack should mostly be one-off in nature (quick questions/brief check-ins/notifications). Lab members are expected to maintain good organizational and note-taking practices for their projects.
  * Lab members are encouraged to set statuses (e.g. *do not disturb*, *in lab*, *working from home*, *on holiday*). William will also set statuses for a quick sign of his availability (e.g. *in office*, *teaching*, etc.).
* For any important communication (e.g. anything that might need documentation/record-keeping, such as where a decision is being made) or any messaging with a large group or external collaborators, use email.
  * Remember to be mindful of email etiquette - try to avoid spam by batching multiple questions into the one email, keeping them within the one thread.
* William will try to organise in-person meetings (~weekly) for discussing research projects (i.e. ideation, results, etc.). William might drop by the lab sporadically to check-in with whoever is around (and will try to be mindful of placing pressure on being in lab.)
* **For emergencies, do not hesitate to contact William by phone.**

## Mentorship {#lab-mentorship}

Lab members are encouraged to seek mentorship from many people and places, such that they learn from a diverse set of perspectives and experience. This could be from a senior graduate student or postdoc in the PALM Lab or in another lab, from a research collaborator or co-supervisor, and of course, from William. All PALM Lab members are recommended to think about what **skills** they would like to learn, what **goals** they have in life and in science, and what may be an **inspiration** to them, and to seek out mentors who can help them with that (*it may not always be William!*).

### Expectations for William as a research supervisor {#will-mentor}

William is expected to provide mentorship that includes:

* Research training on experimental design, programming, data collection, data management, statistical analysis, computational modeling, manuscript writing, open scholarship, and further.
* Providing feedback in a timely manner (such as comments on project ideas, approval on conference submissions, suggestions on talks, edits on manuscripts, etc.)
* Giving thoughtful advice on and provide opportunities for achieving future success and preparing you for your the next step in your career (in science/academia or otherwise)
* Creating a healthy learning environment that encourages asking questions without judgment
* Being accessible both in-person and virtually (e-mail or otherwise), including regular meetings to discuss research (or anything else)

> _I hope to be a supportive supervisor for all PALM Lab members, fostering a working relationship that lasts throughout their journey in academia and science._
>
> _I will help all mentees navigate the obstacles and challenges of academia as best I can, and I hope to set an example of how to conduct impactful and rigorous science, through open scholarship practices and service for the community. -- William_

#### Mentorship style {-}

William will always strive for his mentees to achieve success towards their goals. William tries to balance being a hands-on supervisor (for example, getting involved with programming, data collection, data analysis, and further), while encouraging independence and self-directed learning. William operates on a so-called 'open-door' model -- lab members are encouraged to reach out to him with any questions at any time, and to openly ask for the support they need. This includes, where appropriate, emotional support and encouragement while navigating challenges in science and academia.

William is fairly flexible in mentoring style, adapting to the mentee -- lab members are encouraged to 'mentor up' [(see this useful guide on mentoring up by Lee et al.,  p.141)](https://graduateschool.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lee-et-al..pdf). This includes discussing and aligning expectations, asking for and accepting advice and feedback, and having a roadmap for personal development (which William could help you plan!). You can also read more on [expectations of students below](#student-expectations).

You can find out a little bit more about William on [his personal academic website](https://williamngiam.github.io).

#### Weaknesses {-}

> _I believe one key characteristic of a good scientist is their humility, because it goes hand in hand with accepting one's imperfections and being open to change. I acknowledge that I have weakenesses and imperfect understsanding, which I list below so that you are better aware when working with me. -- William_

* I set a high standard of science for myself and the work that I am involved in -- one that goes beyond the norm for the field. For example, I take the additional steps of code review, reproducibility checks, replication of experiments and preparation of data for open access, rather than seeing the end goal as a publication. This high standard can put pressure on my collaborators - for example, rethinking how things are being done and potentially slowing research outputs from reaching stages of progress.
  * I can see that this high standard might mean I appear overly critical, especially if I were to give critique without kindness or not to voice any positive feedback. My past mentees have not voiced this concern, but please do not hesitate to remind me to say what went well!
* As I am newly starting the PALM Lab, I am not inexperienced with conducting research specifically at the University of Adelaide, and am yet to secure my own external research funding.
* I have a tendency to overcommit, having trouble saying 'no' when new opportunities arise. This may mean I am spread thin at times, leading to less timely responses or feedback.
* I value work-life balance, but do go through phases where I am doing 'work' late or on weekends -- I am usually reading related papers, or getting fixated on fixing programming issues or solving other problems. This may lead to message or responses at odd times, which I hope does not lead to the expectation that you should also work odd hours. (I will be very clear about this!)

## Resolving conflicts {#conflicts}

Conflicts within the lab or with others can occur despite our best intentions and efforts to prevent them. The hope is that conflicts will be resolved through listening to each other, understanding each other's perspective and respectfully reaching an agreed upon course of action.

If there is any potential for disagreement or unhappiness that cannot be resolved by discussing with the other party, the first person to talk to is William. However, if William does not seem to be the right person (or the conflict is sourced by or with William), then the following contacts may be helpful:

* If you are a PhD student, the members of your thesis committee or the Dean of Learning
* If you are not a PhD student, seek out ....
