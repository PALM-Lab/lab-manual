# Lab Resources

This chapter provides useful links to software and associated resources for conducting research in the PALM Lab.

## Required

The following are likely needed for conducting research in the PALM Lab.

### MATLAB {-}

The code for conducting the experiments and data analysis will mostly be written in MATLAB. The University of Adelaide provides [access to download and use the licensed software](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/university-of-adelaide-30536634.html). If a lab member is an experienced programmer (i.e. requiring little coding supervision from William), they can choose to write all experimental code in Python.

#### PsychToolbox {-}

The software we use for building psychology experiments (i.e. displaying stimuli and collecting responses) comes from [PsychToolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/). The Python alternative is PsychoPy.

#### EEGLAB {-}

The software we use for analysing EEG data within the MATLAB environment is [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php). Our artifact rejection pipeline can be found on Github.

### R and RStudio {-}

To run some statistical analyses, we use R and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 

[R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is a free book that is a great introduction into using R for data analysis and visualization.

### Github and Github Desktop {-}

For code management and version control, the lab uses Git and [Github](https://github.com). The [PALM Lab's Github](https://github.com/PALM-Lab) will contain all code repositories for our lab, including shared packages for our common processing or analyses (such as artifact rejection of EEG). 

Github's [own start-up guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) is a good place to start. For those less experienced with programming, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an easy-to-use interface for maintaining code between your local computer and Github.

## Recommended

### Zotero {-}

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a software app for organizing scientific papers and managing references. It has an in-built reader with note taking capabilities.

[Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) is a very useful Google Chrome extension for adding journal articles directly into Zotero from Google Scholar or journal webpages.

### Jamovi or JASP {-}

### Tenzing {-#tenzing}

[*Tenzing*](https://tenzing.club) is an easy-to-use web app for quickly generating the author list, their affiliations and their contributions according to the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT). The PALM Lab uses a [policy of contributorship](#contributorship) to credit researchers. Use *tenzing* to generate the CRediT roles prior to the submission of a research manuscript for publication.

The app was created by Alex Holcombe, Marton Kovacs, Frederik Aust and Balazs Aczel.

[Holcombe, A. O., Kovacs, M., Aust, F., & Aczel, B. (2020). Documenting contributions to scholarly articles using CRediT and tenzing. PLoS ONE, 15(12), e0244611.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244611).

## Optional

### Obsidian {-}

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note-taking and note management software that is designed to be a 'second brain'. Notes are written and saved as Markdown files, and with the use of tags and links, can provide a powerful organization and navigation of the notes. Obsidian does have a steep learning curve and requires some setting up to work best for you.

### Adobe Illustrator {-}

Adobe Illustrator is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, and is useful for editing and cleaning up scientific figures for publication (for example, *generating vector graphics to the appropriate sizes*), and for creating well-designed conference posters.
