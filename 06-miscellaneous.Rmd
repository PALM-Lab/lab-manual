## Collaborators

### The University of Adelaide

The University of Adelaide has a collaborative research culture, with many working on understanding brain and behaviour.

### Awh/Vogel Lab at the University of Chicago

William was a postdoctoral researcher with Prof Edward Awh and Prof Edward Vogel at the University of Chicago, and has developed a long-time working relationship with them. Expect a lot of collaboration and discussion with them.

### holcLab at the University of Sydney

For his PhD, William was supervised by Prof Alex Holcombe at the University of Sydney, who gave his start in visual perception research and inspired his advocacy for open scholarship. The holcLab is interested in the limits of visual attention and uses psychophysical paradigms like the multiple-object tracking (MOT).
