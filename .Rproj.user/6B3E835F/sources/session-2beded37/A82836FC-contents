# Welcome! {-}

This is the lab manual for the **P**erception, **A**ttention, **L**earning and **M**emory **Lab** at the University of Adelaide, run by Dr William Ngiam! We are a cognitive psychology and neuroscience lab researching how we keep information in mind for ongoing cognition.

This lab manual contains the guidelines, policies, and other resources for how we conduct our research. It is a continual work in progress, as the way we conduct our scientific research evolves.

This lab manual is inspired by many others including:
