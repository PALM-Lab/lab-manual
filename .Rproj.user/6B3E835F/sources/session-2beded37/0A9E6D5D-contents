# Resources

This chapter lists useful software and resources for conducting research in the PALM Lab.

## Recommended

### Zotero

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a software app for reference management.

[Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) is a very useful Google Chrome extension for adding journal articles directly into Zotero from Google Scholar or journal webpages.

### Github and Github Desktop

### Tenzing {#tenzing}

[*Tenzing*](https://tenzing.club) is an easy-to-use web app for quickly generating the author list, their affiliations and their contributions according to the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT). The PALM Lab uses a [policy of contributorship](#contributorship) to credit researchers. Use *tenzing* to generate the CRediT roles prior to the submission of a research manuscript for publication.

The app was created by Alex Holcombe, Marton Kovacs, Frederik Aust and Balazs Aczel.

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
